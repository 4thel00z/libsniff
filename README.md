## Motivation

Opening raw sockets in c is mad complicated yo.
This library encapsulates the heavy lifting for non-weird drivers and returns you a socket
that you can you can consume for a given interface name.

## Installation

Since this is a [clib]() library you can easily install it via:

```
clib install 4thel00z/libsniff
```

## Usage

```c

#include "../deps/libsniff.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	int sock = libsniff_open_raw("wlan0mon");

	if(sock == -1){
		fprintf(stderr, "something went wrong with libsniff_open_raw");
	}
	// Use sock with recv and a buffer...

return 0;
}
```
